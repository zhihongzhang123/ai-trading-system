## Sentiment Data Assistance

The system retrieves sentiment data through the Gate MCP News endpoint as a supplementary reference to technical analysis, helping each strategy make more comprehensive decisions.

### Sentiment Data Source and Collection

- **Data Source**: Fetches 3 types of sentiment data via the Gate MCP News endpoint: crypto news, exchange announcements, and social sentiment
- **Collection Method**: Sentiment data is collected in parallel with technical data in each trading cycle
- **On-Demand Query**: AI can use 3 sentiment tools to query deeper information as needed
- **Supplementary Role**: Sentiment data is for reference only and does not replace technical analysis; technical analysis remains the core basis for decisions
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure to obtain sentiment data does not affect the main trading flow

### Sentiment Application by Strategy

| Strategy Type | Sentiment Application |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Conservative/Balanced | Sentiment data for risk alerts (e.g., reduce position on major negative news) |
| Aggressive | Sentiment data for event-driven trading opportunities |
| AI Autonomous | AI decides how to use sentiment data |
| Alpha-Beta | Sentiment data as an additional analysis dimension to assist signal scoring |

### Configuration

| Configuration Item | Description | Default |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| `GATE_NEWS_MCP_ENABLED` | Enable or disable sentiment feature | Enabled by default; set to `false` to disable |
| `GATE_NEWS_MCP_URL` | MCP endpoint URL | `https://api.gatemcp.ai/mcp/news` |

No additional configuration is required; the system enables sentiment data collection by default.

- **Execution Cycle**: 5 minutes (Configuration location: `.env` file `TRADING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5`)
- **Recommended Holding Duration**: 30 minutes - 2 hours
- **Leverage Range**: 3-5x (50%-75% of MAX_LEVERAGE)
  - Code: `leverageMin: Math.max(3, Math.ceil(maxLeverage * 0.5))`
  - Code: `leverageMax: Math.max(5, Math.ceil(maxLeverage * 0.75))`
- **Position Size**: 18-25%

   - AI includes this rule in prompts and automatically executes
3. **Trailing Stop**:
   - Profit ≥+4% → Move stop to +1.5%
     - Code: `trailingStop.level1: { trigger: 4, stopAt: 1.5 }`
   - Profit ≥+8% → Move stop to +4%
     - Code: `trailingStop.level2: { trigger: 8, stopAt: 4 }`
   - Profit ≥+15% → Move stop to +8%
     - Code: `trailingStop.level3: { trigger: 15, stopAt: 8 }`

### Multi-Agent Jury Strategy (`multi-agent-consensus`)

**Core Philosophy**: Judge and jury deliberation model, main agent independent analysis + three professional agents assistance, pursuing high-quality decisions

> **⚠️ Important Notice: Token Consumption Warning**
> 
> The jury strategy uses a multi-agent collaboration mode (1 main agent + 3 professional agents), requiring multiple AI model calls for each decision.
> 
> **Cost Impact**:
> - Token consumption is approximately **3-4 times** that of single-agent strategies
> - Each decision cycle requires 4 AI model calls (Judge 1 time + Jury 3 times)
> - With 5-minute execution cycle, approximately 288 × 4 = **1152 AI calls per day**
> 
> **Recommendations**:
> - Only use when you have sufficient budget and pursue extremely high decision quality
> - Consider extending execution cycle (e.g., 10 or 15 minutes) to reduce costs
> - Monitor API fees to ensure they remain within acceptable range
> - Users with limited budget should use single-agent strategies (e.g., swing-trend, ai-autonomous)

#### Strategy Parameters

> **Configuration File Location**: `src/strategies/multiAgentConsensus.ts`

- **Execution Cycle**: 5-10 minutes (Configuration location: `.env` file `TRADING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5`)
- **Recommended Holding Duration**: Hours - Days
- **Leverage Range**: 14-20x (55%-80% of MAX_LEVERAGE)
  - Code: `leverageMin: Math.max(2, Math.ceil(maxLeverage * 0.55))`
  - Code: `leverageMax: Math.max(3, Math.ceil(maxLeverage * 0.80))`
  - Note: When MAX_LEVERAGE=25, actual leverage is 14-20x
- **Position Size**: 18-25%
  - Code: `positionSizeMin: 18, positionSizeMax: 25`
- **Stop-Loss Range**: -6% ~ -8%
  - Code: `stopLoss: { low: -6, mid: -7, high: -8 }`

#### Core Advantages

1. **Multi-Agent Collaborative Decision**: Judge (main agent) + three professional agents (technical analysis, trend analysis, risk assessment)
2. **Deliberation Decision-Making**: Judge analyzes independently first, listens to jury opinions, then makes final judgment
3. **Not Simple Voting**: Weighs persuasiveness of opinions, not simple majority rule
4. **Dual Protection Mechanism**: Code auto-monitoring + AI proactive decision
5. **Reduce Decision Bias**: Multi-perspective analysis reduces single-agent cognitive blind spots

#### Dual Protection Mechanism

The jury strategy adopts the same dual protection mode as the AI autonomous strategy:

**Layer 1: Code-Level Auto Protection** (Every 10 seconds monitoring, safety net)
- **Auto Stop-Loss**:
  - Low leverage (2-10x): Auto close at -6% loss
  - Medium leverage (11-15x): Auto close at -7% loss
  - High leverage (16x+): Auto close at -8% loss
- **Auto Trailing Stop**:
  - At +10% profit, move stop to +4% (lock profit)
  - At +18% profit, move stop to +10% (lock more profit)
  - At +28% profit, move stop to +18% (protect most profit)
- **Auto Partial Take-Profit**:
  - At +25% profit, auto close 40% (lock partial profit)
  - At +35% profit, auto close 40% (continue locking profit)
  - At +45% profit, auto close 100% (take all profit)

**Layer 2: AI Proactive Decision** (Flexible operation rights)
- Judge can proactively stop-loss/take-profit **before** code auto protection triggers
- Judge can flexibly adjust according to market conditions, no need to wait for auto trigger
- Judge can stop-loss earlier (avoid bigger losses)
- Judge can take-profit earlier (secure profit)
- Code protection is the last safety net, judge has full proactive control

#### Jury Members

1. **Technical Analysis Agent**: Analyzes technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
2. **Trend Analysis Agent**: Analyzes multi-timeframe trends (1m/3m/5m/15m/1h/4h)
3. **Risk Assessment Agent**: Assesses market risks and position risks

#### Workflow

1. **Judge Independent Analysis**: Judge analyzes market independently first, forms preliminary judgment
2. **Consult Jury**: Use `delegate_task` tool to call three professional agents
3. **Collect Opinions**: Gather analysis opinions and suggestions from three agents
4. **Deliberation Decision**: Judge synthesizes all opinions (including own judgment) to make final decision
5. **Execute Decision**: Judge executes open/close/observe operations (only judge can execute trades)

#### Entry Conditions (Judge Executes)

- **Must Obtain Jury Opinions**: At least consult technical analysis, trend analysis, and risk assessment agents
- **Comprehensive Judgment**: Not simple majority vote, but weighing persuasiveness of opinions
- **Signal Strength Grading**:
  - Normal signal: 18-20% position, 14x leverage
  - Good signal: 20-23% position, 17x leverage
  - Strong signal: 23-25% position, 20x leverage
- **Emergency Situations**: When position loss approaches stop-loss line, judge can skip jury and decide directly

#### Applicable Scenarios

**Most Suitable**:
- Pursuing robust decision-making, emphasizing risk control
- Hoping to reduce decision bias through multi-perspective analysis
- Can accept holding periods of hours to days
- Not in a hurry for frequent trading, pursuing high-quality signals
- Hoping for dual protection (code + AI)
- **Sufficient budget to afford 3-4x token costs** (Important)
- No strict limitations on API calls

**Not Suitable**:
- Pursuing extremely high-frequency trading (jury decision takes time)
- Market fluctuates extremely fast, requiring second-level decisions
- Don't like complex decision processes
- **Limited budget, cannot afford 3-4x token costs**
- Users with API call limitations or cost-sensitive

#### Configuration Example

> **Configuration File Location**: `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`)

```bash
# Environment Variable Configuration
TRADING_STRATEGY=multi-agent-consensus
TRADING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5      # Recommended 5-10 minutes

MAX_POSITIONS=3                  # Maximum 3 positions (cautious entry)
INITIAL_BALANCE=2000
```

#### Expected Returns

- **Monthly Target Return**: 20-35%
- **Win Rate Target**: 40-50% (improved through multi-agent decision)
- **Profit-Loss Ratio Target**: ≥2.5:1
- **Sharpe Ratio**: ≥1.8

## Best Practice Recommendations

### Swing Trend Strategy Best Practices

1. **Wait Patiently for Signals**
   - Wait for all 4 timeframes (1m/3m/5m/15m) to resonate
   - Ensure MACD, RSI, EMA directions are consistent
   - Don't rush to open, quality over quantity

2. **Trust Auto Monitoring**
   - Auto monitoring system checks every 10 seconds
   - Stop-loss and take-profit execute automatically, no AI intervention needed
   - AI focuses on finding high-quality opening opportunities

3. **Reasonable Position Sizing**
   - Normal signals: 20-25% position
   - Good signals: 25-30% position
   - Strong signals: 30-35% position (use cautiously)

4. **Reasonable Leverage Use**
   - Normal signals: 2x leverage (safest)
   - Good signals: 3x leverage (balanced)
   - Strong signals: 5x leverage (maximum, use cautiously)

5. **Control Simultaneous Positions**
   - Recommendation: 1-3 positions (`MAX_POSITIONS=3`)
   - Avoid over-diversification, maintain capital concentration

6. **Understand Automated Protection**
   - Stop-loss: Auto close immediately when stop-loss line touched
   - Take-profit: Auto close immediately when peak pullback target met
   - AI only needs to explain position status in reports

### Ultra-Short Strategy Best Practices

1. **Quick In and Out**
   - Consider locking profit immediately when profit >2%
   - Don't be greedy, small profits are still profits

2. **Strictly Follow Rules**
   - System's 2% profit lock and 30-minute rule are experience summaries
   - Don't try to manually intervene

3. **High-Frequency Monitoring**
   - 5-minute cycle requires more frequent monitoring

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why doesn't the AI actively close positions in the Swing Strategy?
**A**: To achieve more stable and consistent risk control execution. The auto monitoring system checks every 10 seconds and closes positions immediately when conditions are met, which is more timely than the AI's 20-minute execution cycle. AI focuses on finding high-quality opening opportunities, closing is handled by the auto monitoring system, achieving separation of responsibilities and higher efficiency.

### Q2: Will auto monitoring close positions too early?
**A**: Auto monitoring uses 5-level trailing stop rules, dynamically adjusting based on profit peaks. For example, at 10% peak, it only closes on a 2.5% pullback, which both protects profits (minimum 7.5%) and gives trends enough room. This balance is carefully designed.

### Q3: Why does the Swing Strategy use 1m/3m/5m/15m short cycles?
**A**: Although called "swing", entry timing needs to be precise. Short-cycle combinations (1-15 minutes) can capture early signals of trend formation faster, avoiding lag from using longer cycles like 4 hours. Holding time can still reach several days, letting profits fully run.

### Q4: Isn't 20-35% position size too large?
**A**: It depends on signal strength. 30-35% is only used for strong signals (4 timeframes perfectly resonating + technical indicators extremely consistent), normal signals only use 20-25%. Combined with 2-5x low leverage and strict auto monitoring stop-loss, risk is controllable.

### Q5: Can I run multiple strategies simultaneously?
**A**: Not recommended. Each strategy has different risk control rules and execution logic, running simultaneously may cause conflicts. It's recommended to choose one strategy to focus on based on market conditions.

### Q6: How to evaluate strategy effectiveness?
**A**: Focus on these metrics:
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades (Swing strategy target 35-45%)
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Average profit/Average loss (target ≥2:1)
- **Monthly Return**: Monthly total return (Swing strategy target 20-35%)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return (target ≥1.5)
- **Max Drawdown**: Maximum peak-to-trough decline (control within 20%)
- **Stop-Loss Timeliness**: Auto monitoring response speed (10-second check)

## Technical Implementation

> **Core File Locations**:
> - Strategy Module: `src/strategies/` directory
> - Unified Strategy Exports: `src/strategies/index.ts`
> - Strategy Type Definitions: `src/strategies/types.ts`
> - Trading Agent: `src/agents/tradingAgent.ts`
> - Risk Control Parameters: `src/config/riskParams.ts`
> - Trading Loop: `src/scheduler/tradingLoop.ts`

All strategy implementations follow a unified architectural pattern:

1. **Strategy Parameter Definition**: Each strategy defines complete parameter configurations in its corresponding `.ts` file, including leverage range, position size, stop-loss range, etc.
   - Ultra-Short: `src/strategies/ultraShort.ts` → `getUltraShortStrategy()`
   - Swing Trend: `src/strategies/swingTrend.ts` → `getSwingTrendStrategy()`
   - Conservative: `src/strategies/conservative.ts` → `getConservativeStrategy()`
   - Balanced: `src/strategies/balanced.ts` → `getBalancedStrategy()`
   - Aggressive: `src/strategies/aggressive.ts` → `getAggressiveStrategy()`
   - Rebate Farming: `src/strategies/rebateFarming.ts` → `getRebateFarmingStrategy()`
   - AI Autonomous: `src/strategies/aiAutonomous.ts` → `getAiAutonomousStrategy()`
   - Multi-Agent Jury: `src/strategies/multiAgentConsensus.ts` → `getMultiAgentConsensusStrategy()`
   - **Alpha Beta (Default)**: `src/strategies/alphaBeta.ts` → `getAlphaBetaStrategy()`

2. **Prompt Generation**: Each strategy file contains a `generateXxxPrompt()` function that generates strategy-specific decision prompts for the AI
   - Ultra-Short: `generateUltraShortPrompt()`
   - Swing Trend: `generateSwingTrendPrompt()`
   - Conservative: `generateConservativePrompt()`
   - Balanced: `generateBalancedPrompt()`
   - Aggressive: `generateAggressivePrompt()`
   - Rebate Farming: `generateRebateFarmingPrompt()`
   - AI Autonomous: `generateAiAutonomousPrompt()`
   - Multi-Agent Jury: `generateMultiAgentConsensusPrompt()`
   - **Alpha Beta (Default)**: `generateAlphaBetaPrompt()`

3. **Unified Exports**: All strategies are exported through `src/strategies/index.ts` for easy system calls

### Strategy Selection Logic

> **Implementation File**: `src/strategies/index.ts`

The system dynamically loads the corresponding strategy based on the `TRADING_STRATEGY` environment variable:

```typescript
// In src/strategies/index.ts
export function getStrategyParams(strategy: TradingStrategy, maxLeverage: number): StrategyParams {
  switch (strategy) {
    case "ultra-short":
      return getUltraShortStrategy(maxLeverage);
    case "swing-trend":
      return getSwingTrendStrategy(maxLeverage);
    case "conservative":
      return getConservativeStrategy(maxLeverage);
    case "balanced":
      return getBalancedStrategy(maxLeverage);
    case "aggressive":
      return getAggressiveStrategy(maxLeverage);
    case "alpha-beta":
      return getAlphaBetaStrategy(maxLeverage);
    default:
      return getAlphaBetaStrategy(maxLeverage);  // Default: Alpha Beta strategy
  }
}
```
